# main: 
    1- todo-list: 
        # - 1 - the main ones that shown at the top of the todo-list section 
        # - 2 - the secondary ones that I can see when i open there page or there tab or there window.
        - 1 - the todos should be listed in order of there priority
    2- remainders: 





## Notes:
    ~ when i checked the todo it marked down as finished and it will be removed from the todos to there
    ~ finished todos
     
    ~ add priority for each todo when the user is adding them
    
    ~ the main page sho

    ~ i need to add a feature like the one in github, the one that show much did i was in the year, the more 
    ~ i mark down todos the color become more darker

### what i wanted to do :
    add a special color to each priority button and a backgroundColor in the jsx page, and in the css page 
    i want to add an effect that make the backgroundColor disperse in the normal state but when i hover it 
    the backgroundColor will be shown
